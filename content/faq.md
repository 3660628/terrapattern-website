# Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the Basic Idea? 

You select a region to search within, such as the city of Pittsburgh
You select a 


### What can you use this for? 

One of our friends is using it to find disused swimming pools -- for [guerilla skateboarding](http://www.epictv.com/media/podcast/inside-californias-guerrilla-pool-skate-scene-%7C-pool-nation-ep-1/600243). 

### The results I'm getting don't seem accurate. 

* It's tile-based search, not pixel-based. The system may be offering up tiles that match your selected tile on different visual features than the ones you're expecting. If possible, try selecting a different tile that better contains your object of interest.
* The tiles may have changed since we built our model. 
* It's scale dependent. We examine the world at level 19. 
* You may have selected something truly unique. 

### Is this art? 

Maybe. 

### I discovered something cool. How can I share it?

We'd love to hear your stories and feedback! If you discover something interesting, send a tweet with the hashtag #terrapattern and the GPS coordinates of your discovery. We also invite you to complete this brief survey to tell us what you think!

### Why have you only offered three cities? 

It's the scale we could afford. The model data for each metro region requires about 10GB of active RAM. (That's *RAM* —not hard disk.) To store and serve a searchable model for (say) the entire United States would require more than 1,000 times as much RAM and CPU power as we're currently leasing, and the development of a much more sophisticated software architecture as well. Think of the *Terrapattern* project as you're presently experiencing it as a proof-of-concept probe to test how or whether "visual query-by-example" for satellite imagery could be a part of our future. Remember, you saw it here first. 

### Why did you select the cities you did? 

Most of the members of our team currently call Pittsburgh home, and it's always great to start one's research there. We furthermore selected New York City and San Francisco because so many of our friends and peers live there—especially those investigating new intersections of art, design, journalism, technology, data science and social change.
