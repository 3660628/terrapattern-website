### Motivation and Intended Use

It has been predicted that, within the next three years, access to daily-updated, whole-earth satellite imagery with sub-meter resolution will become widely available online. There will be many important stories about natural and human activities latent in this data. Without special effort, however, it is doubtful that this imagery will have annotation layers that make such stories discoverable.

In light of this, the *Terrapattern* prototype is intended to demonstrate a workflow by which users&mdash;such as journalists, citizen scientists, humanitarian agencies, social justice activists, archaeologists, urban planners, and other researchers&mdash;can easily search for visually consistent "patterns of interest". We are particularly keen to help people identify, characterize and track indicators which have not been detected or measured previously, and which have sociological, humanitarian, scientific, or cultural significance. 

Our goal is to provide a geospatial software tool that makes it easy for everyday people, who may lack expertise in machine vision, to specify the *thing* that they are interested in; to automatically find more examples of that *thing*; and to provide the locations of those instances in a common data format that easily allows for further examination.
