### Examples

Terrapattern is ideal for discovering, locating and labeling typologies that aren't customarily indicated on maps. These might include ephemeral or temporally-contingent features (such as vehicles or construction sites), or the sorts of banal infrastructure (like fracking wells or smokestacks) that only appear on specialist blueprints, if they appear at all. 

In this section, we share some discoveries of our own, made with the Terrapattern system. It is important to point out that the Terrapattern system   was not *trained* on any of the categories shown below, but instead recognizes them because of their common visual features. 

Here, for example, are [golf course sand traps](http://pgh.terrapattern.com/?lat=40.5261395&lng=-79.8810095) identified by our system in the Pittsburgh metro region:
