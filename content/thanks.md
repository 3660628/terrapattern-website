#### Professor Levin and the Terrapattern team gratefully acknowledge the following individuals and organizations for their support and encouragement:

We express our gratitude to [**Knight Foundation**](http://www.knightfoundation.org/), and in particular [Chris Barr](http://www.knightfoundation.org/staff/chris-barr/), Director of the Media Innovation program and manager of the Knight Prototype Fund, and [Eva Pereira](http://www.knightfoundation.org/staff/eva-pereira/), Media Innovation Associate, for their advocacy, support, and patient cultivation of our investigation.

Members of the Carnegie Mellon University [**CREATE Lab**](http://cmucreatelab.org/) provided essential advice and guidance in performing large-scale computations on satellite imagery for humanitarian purposes. We are especially grateful to [Randy Sargent](http://www.ri.cmu.edu/person.html?type=newsmedia&person_id=2434), Paul Dille, and Professor Illah Nourbakhsh of the CREATE Lab. 

The leadership team of [**DataKind**](http://www.datakind.org/), which works to harness the power of data science in the service of humanity, provided crucial early encouragement of this investigation. We express our gratitude to [Jake Porway](http://www.datakind.org/our-team), Founder and Executive Director, and [Erin Akred](http://www.datakind.org/our-team), Chief Data Scientist and Head of DataKind Labs, for their interest and support. 

Our colleagues in the CMU [**Machine Learning Department**](http://www.ml.cmu.edu/) (MLD) provided key technical advice and support. In particular, our project uses an implementation of [*Cover Trees*](https://github.com/manzilzaheer/CoverTree), developed by Manzil Zaheer in the MLD, for fast, asynchronous nearest neighbor search. This implementation made it possible for our project to function in real-time. We thank Manzil and his professors [Alex Smola](http://alex.smola.org/), David Andersen, and Ruslan Salakhutdinov for their kind support in making this possible.

We thank the organizers of the [**Alt-AI**](http://alt-ai.net/) conference, [Gene Kogan](http://www.genekogan.com/), and the directors of the [**SFPC**](http://sfpc.io/) (School for Poetic Computation), [Lauren Gardner](http://sfpc.io/people/lauren-gardner/), [Taeyoon Choi](http://sfpc.io/people/taeyoon-choi/) and [Zachary Lieberman](http://sfpc.io/people/zach-lieberman/), for kindly inviting the *Terrapattern* project to premiere in an [exhibition](http://alt-ai.net/#exhibition) at this unique conference event and venue. 

We gratefully acknowledge [**Planet Labs**](https://www.planet.com/), and in particular Andrew Zolli, Joe Mascaro, and [Rob Simmon](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/elegantfigures/), for their interest and encouragement, and for providing access to geospatial data through their Ambassadors Program.

To train our neural network, our project made use of nearly 500,000 nodes, polygons and other map labels meticulously contributed by the members of the [**OpenStreetMap**](https://www.openstreetmap.org) volunteer community over nearly ten years. It has been [pointed out](http://www.spacemachine.net/views/2016/3/datasets-over-algorithms) that many AI breakthroughs have been constrained by the availability of high-quality training datasets. We are grateful to the OSM commmunity for developing and releasing their freely-reusable geospatial data.

We thank our friends, [Rich Pell](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/rp3h/) (founder and co-director of the [Center for Postnatural History](http://www.postnatural.org/)), [Ingrid Burrington](http://lifewinning.com/), [Jenny Odell](http://www.jennyodell.com/), [Clement Valla](http://clementvalla.com/), and [Charlie Loyd](https://twitter.com/vruba), for invaluable suggestions and discussions about how our project might help us understand the anthropocene. 

Last, but not least, we acknowledge the support of our hardworking staff and students at the [**Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry**](studioforcreativeinquiry.org), including Tom Hughes, Linda Hager, [Dan Moore](makeitdoathing.com), Johanna McAllister, Aprameya Mysore, and [Charlotte Stiles](http://charlottestiles.com/).
