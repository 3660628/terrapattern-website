### Inspirations

The Terrapattern project seeks to democratize geospatial intelligence. By providing a means by which researchers, journalists, citizen scientists, and artists can quickly and easily scan extremely large geographical areas for specific visual features, our hope is that the public at large will gain the ability to research and answer questions about our world that are otherwise unknowable. 

Access to satellite imagery, especially as it can be interpreted through the lens of machine intelligence, is currently controlled by a select few: state-level actors and (increasingly) multinational businesses. Once the exclusive domain of top-secret military surveillance, high-resolution satellite imagery has recently become heavily corporatized. At the forefront of this shift are companies like [Orbital Insight](https://orbitalinsight.com/), [Remote Sensing Metrics](https://www.rsmetrics.com/) and [Genscape](http://www.genscape.com/), which apply machine learning algorithms to satellite imagery in order to sell "actionable intelligence" to hedge funds and other market speculators. For example, in their "[US Retail Traffic Index](https://orbitalinsight.com/solutions/us-retail-traffic-indices/)", RS Metrics monitors the number of cars in retail parking lots, in order to estimate the quarterly performance of big-box stores before those results have been released. Similarly, Orbital Insight's "[World Oil Storage Index](https://orbitalinsight.com/solutions/world-oil-storage-index/)" consists of daily estimates of the amount of oil held in 20,000 storage tanks&mdash;intelligence derived from the size of shadows on the interiors of tanks with floating lids. With enormous amounts of money to be made in the trade of such information products, this type of understanding about the forces shaping our world remains very far from being a public good.

We wondered what it would be like to provide an **"Orbital Insight for the rest of humanity"**: a tool that could help those who are concerned about or interested in the world&mdash;whether through environmental studies, journalism, humanitarian efforts, social sciences, natural sciences, or artistic inquiry&mdash;obtain geospatial understanding of the kind only previously available to a select few. In this section, we highlight a few projects by others which we consider powerfully inspirational illustrations of this: the democratization of machine intelligence for satellite imagery.

At the forefront of environmental efforts is the non-profit organization, [Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project](http://maaproject.org/en/) (MAAP), which uses satellite imagery and computer vision to analyze the Amazonian rainforest. In some of their best-known work, MAAP has successfully detected [illegal gold mines] (http://maaproject.org/2016/invasion-tambopata-3/), as well as [illegal logging roads](http://maaproject.org/2015/maap18-logroads/), which are precursors to deforestation.

The telescopic perspective of satellite imagery has enormous potential to provide *scientific* insights that could not be obtained otherwise.  For example, "Space archaeologist" [Dr. Sarah Parcak](http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2014/12/start/scanning-the-past), a professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, has used remote sensing technologies, image processing and computer vision in order to discover ancient Egyptian pyramids and even a previously unknown site of Viking activity in North America. In another fascinating discovery, Dr. Sabine Begall, a professor of Zoology at the University of Duisburg-Essen, has discovered that ruminants have a previously undiscovered geomagnetic sense&mdash;essentially, that [grazing cows align themselves with the earth's magnetic field](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/08/22/0803650105).

The Signal Program worked with 2014 HHI

a prototype feature extraction algorithm,
called “Tukul Detector”. The Tukul DetecSIGNAL
PROGRAM

TECHNOLOGY
tor identifies and counts traditional African
huts, known as “tukuls”, that are routinely
present in satellite imagery of rural regions
in Africa. 

Whether these patterns concern elephants, parking lots, logging roads, oil tanks, swimming pools, construction sites, munitions craters, methane blowholes, or other phenomena, we cannot predict: it is only important that the patterns of interest are visually consistent enough for algorithmic detection and analysis.

The Terrapattern project is only a prototype, especially in its scale, and we feel we have only scratched the surface of what is possible.
