Democratization. 

Once the exclusive domain of top-secret military surveillance, high-resolution satellite imagery has quickly become heavily corporatized. There is enormous money to be made. At the forefront of this are companies like [Orbital Insight](https://orbitalinsight.com/), [Remote Sensing Metrics](https://www.rsmetrics.com/) and [Genscape](http://www.genscape.com/), which apply machine learning algorithms to satellite imagery in order to sell "actionable intelligence" to hedge funds and other market speculators. For example, in their "[US Retail Traffic Index](https://orbitalinsight.com/solutions/us-retail-traffic-indices/)", RS Metrics monitors the number of cars in retail parking lots, in order to estimate the quarterly performance of big-box stores before those results have been released. Likewise, Orbital Insight's "[World Oil Storage Index](https://orbitalinsight.com/solutions/world-oil-storage-index/)" produces daily estimates of the amount of oil held in 20,000 storage tanks—by measuring the size of shadows on the interiors of tanks with floating lids.

The Signal Program worked with 2014 HHI
fellow Michael Hughes last year to develop
a prototype feature extraction algorithm,
called “Tukul Detector”. The Tukul DetecSIGNAL
PROGRAM
ON HUMAN SECURITY AND
TECHNOLOGY
tor identifies and counts traditional African
huts, known as “tukuls”, that are routinely
present in satellite imagery of rural regions
in Africa. 

Whether these patterns concern elephants, parking lots, logging roads, oil tanks, swimming pools, construction sites, munitions craters, methane blowholes, or other phenomena, we cannot predict: it is only important that the patterns of interest are visually consistent enough for algorithmic detection and analysis.
