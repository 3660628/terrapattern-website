## Overview

**We present *Terrapattern*: "similar-image search" for satellite photos.** It's an open-source tool for discovering "patterns of interest" in unlabeled satellite imagery&mdash;a prototype for exploring the unmapped, and the unmappable. 

Terrapattern provides an open-ended interface for visual query-by-example. Simply click an interesting spot on Terrapattern's map, and it will find other locations that look similar. Our tool is ideal for locating specialized 'nonbuilding structures' and other forms of soft infrastructure that aren't usually indicated on maps.

There has never been a more exciting time to observe human activity and understand the patterns of humanityâ€™s impact on the world. We aim to help people discover such patterns in satellite imagery, with the help of deep learning machine vision techniques.
