# Technical Bibliography

*The following research projects and open-source codebases are specifically concerned with the application of 'deep-learning' techniques to satellite imagery.*

[Learning to Detect Roads in High-Resolution Aerial
Images](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/road_detection.pdf) by Volodymyr Mnih and Geoffrey E. Hinton (2010), a seminal paper in the application of machine learning to the problem of making assertions about satellite imagery. 
 
[Machine Learning for Aerial Image Labeling](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/Mnih_Volodymyr_PhD_Thesis.pdf), Volodymyr Mnih's 2013 doctoral thesis from the University of Toronto, under the advisement of Geoff Hinton. 

[Humanitarian Mapping with Deep Learning](https://github.com/larsroemheld/OSM-HOT-ConvNet) by Stanford graduate student, Lars Roemheld (2016). Like the *Terrapattern* project, this project uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) to help train a neural net, in order to help support map creation in the developing world.

[OSM-Crosswalk-Detection](https://github.com/geometalab/OSM-Crosswalk-Detection) by Marcel Huber (2015). Developed at the University of Applied Sciences Rapperswil, this project again trains deep learning models with OSM labels to locate Swiss crosswalks.

[DeepOSM](https://github.com/trailbehind/DeepOSM) (2016), by Andrew L. Johnson, trains a neural network with OSM labels and infrared images from the U.S. National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP), in order to detect unmapped hiking trails.
